# Space Blaster

In *Space Blaster*, you pilot a spaceship positioned at the bottom of the screen, tasked with defending yourself against waves of descending alien enemies. You can move your ship left and right and fire lasers to destroy the enemies before they reach you. What sets this game apart is the inclusion of power-ups—collectible items that temporarily enhance your ship’s abilities, such as granting double lasers. The objective is to survive as long as possible, accumulating points by blasting enemies while avoiding collisions.

### Key Features
- **Player Controls:** Move the spaceship and shoot lasers with simple keyboard inputs.
- **Enemy Behavior:** Enemies spawn randomly at the top and descend toward the player.
- **Power-Ups:** Collectible items (e.g., double lasers) add a strategic twist.
- **Scoring System:** Real-time score display tracks your progress.
- **Collision Detection:** Basic system to detect hits between lasers, enemies, and the player.
- **Responsive Design:** Adapts to various screen sizes for broader accessibility.
- **Clean Code:** Written with ES6 classes for modularity and readability.

### Why This Impresses
This game showcases several skills that is appealing:
- **Modern JavaScript:** Leverages ES6 classes and `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth, efficient animations.
- **Code Quality:** Well-structured and commented, demonstrating maintainability.
- **Creativity:** The power-up feature adds a unique layer to a classic shooter concept.
- **Attention to Detail:** Smooth gameplay and a polished feel reflect a focus on user experience.

#### Controls:
- **Left Arrow:** Move the spaceship left.
- **Right Arrow:** Move the spaceship right.
